# Reproducibility Project Introduction
This is a part of my master's capstone project, and the aim was to reproduce most of the figures and tables from a given paper (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-33980-9). In addition,
two extended machine learning models (SVM and XGBoost) were trained using nested cross-validation to predict a binary treatment response.
